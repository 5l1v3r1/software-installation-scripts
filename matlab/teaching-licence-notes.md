Teaching licence uses a different licence server, managed by Chris Paul.

When installaing alongside a research version, modify the start menu target
to explicitly point to the correct licence file:

```
"C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018b\bin\matlab.exe" -c "C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2018b\licenses\network.lic"
```
