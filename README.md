# Software Installation scripts
- A combination of instructions and installation scripts for (research) software.
- Many of the scripts are for HPC (CSF @ University of Manchester), but there are some desktop installations too.
- Most of the Linux scripts should be sourced --- typically those which don't end in `.sh` and don't have a shebang.
